**This project detects only my voice saying a particular trigger word.** 

   It's not a finished project I plan on making it configurable to work with other people, and it can be used in a security system of some sort. 

**The Idea is :**
    
  So I gathered some examples of me saying the trigger word 'Hey sara' and converted it to a waveform image. then used a cnn to distinguish between me and any other voice.
